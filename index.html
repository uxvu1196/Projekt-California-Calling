                <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the

                    what amount to donate. All proceeds will go to the American Red Cross to help the communities that

                <h2>The Golden Bear</h2>
                <p>This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come out
                    stronger than before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California
                    poppy.</p>

This design is inspired by the quote ‘grow through what you go through’ and represents the strength of Californians and how we will continue to thrive, regardless of what knocks us down.
